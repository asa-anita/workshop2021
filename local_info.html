	      ***** Note on Bushfire situation *****
	      As of January 31 2020, there are severe bushfires burning to the South-West of Canberra. Hot weather is expected to continue in to Feb 1, with cooler weather (which usually brings less severe fire danger) expected on Feb 2 and 3. 
		    We are monitoring the situation. So far there is no direct impact on the UNSW Canberra/ADFA campus and we plan to go ahead as normal. 
		    <p>
		    The air quality has been variable (at some times hazardous), though recently the smoke has not made a major impact on the UNSW Canberra campus.  
			    <p>
		    So far, we plan to go ahead with the Molonglo excursion on Feb 5, though we have a backup local excursion planned if the Molonglo site visit cannot occur. 
				    <p>
                    For updates on the bushfire situation, you may check the ACT Emergency Servicies Agency <a href="https://esa.act.gov.au/"> (ESA) website</a> or <a href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me">Fires Near Me </a> NSW for fire spread prediction maps. 
		    For Feb 1 the fires South of Canberra are expected to spread South-East (not much toward Canberra). 
					    <p>
	
		    The Canberra Airport, located North-East of Canberra, is currently open but the situation might change. Please check your flight status prior to your flight.

              <br/>
                UNSW Canberra is approximately 6 minutes by car or 20 minutes by bike from the centre of Canberra, or approximately 30 minutes by bus.

		  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Transport</h2>
		  <font size="+1">
              <p style="text-align: left;">
              From Canberra airport, the easiest way to access the conference venue is utilising a car or taxi, which takes approximately 6 minutes. The conference venue is also accessible from the airport utilising public transport, via the route 5 then route 30 bus. This takes approximately 30 minutes. An Uber from UNSW Canberra/ADFA to the airport costs approx $12-$15. 

          <br/>
          <br/>

          Public transport in Canberra (bus and light rail along Northbourne Avenue) can be paid for utilsing cash fares or a MyWay card; however, the latter is recommended due to the lower fares, which are listed <a href="https://www.transport.act.gov.au/tickets-and-myway/fares"> here</a>. For adult passengers, a single MyWay trip costs $3.22, and the corresponding cash fare is $5.00. MyWay fares include a 90 minute transfer period, allowing you to take numerous bus/light rail services with no additional fare.

		  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Local transport</h2>
          <p style="text-align: left;">
          Perth has several modes of public transport, from buses to trains. These can be paid by cash or a
          <a href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/smartrider/types-of-smartrider/standard-smartrider">Transperth SmartRider Card</a> can be purchased
          (which can be purchased at several <a href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/SmartRider/Retail-Outlets">places</a>).
          To plan your journey, you can use the <a href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/Journey-Planner">Transperth Journey Planner</a> or google maps.
          The principle buses that go between UWA or Curtin University and the city center are the <a href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/timetables/details?Bus=950">950</a> and <a href="http://www.transperth.wa.gov.au/timetables/details?Bus=960">960</a> respectively.
  		  <br/><br/>
          Taxis are also readily available, like <a href="http://www.swantaxis.com.au/">Swan Taxis</a> (<a href="tel:131330">131330</a> from within WA), Maxi Purpose Taxis (<a href="tel:136294">136294</a> from within WA), along with Uber.
		  </p>
		  <p style="text-align: left;">
		  <strong>Travel from Airport</strong><br/>
		  Perth Domestic and International airports are about 11 km and 16 km North-East of the CBD, respectively, accessible by car, taxi, and bus. Our suggestion is to use taxis. Taxi ranks are outside the terminal buildings, and fares are ~$30-35 from the domestic airport to CBD, ~$40-$50 from the international airport to CBD. The Perth Airport City Shuttle has several convenient pick-up points located near hotels, motels and hostels across Perth and can be reached at <a href="tel:+61892777958">+61 8 9277 7958</a>. Transperth Bus 37 departs outside the domestic arrivals terminal, travelling to Perth city centre via St. Georges Terrace (transfer time ~40 mins), and leaves every ~30 mins during the day, hourly after 6PM, and all day Sunday.

		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Accommodation</h2>

		<p style="text-align: left;">
		Delegates are required to book their own accommodation. We strongly recommend that you book early. <br/>
		Below are a list of some of the accommodation available close to the school / workshop venue. We suggest booking accommodation in the CBD, which is approximately equidistant between UWA and Curtin, both of which are accessible by bus.
