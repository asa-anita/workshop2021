<p>Code of Conduct for all Activities of the Astronomical Society of Australia</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Astronomical Society of Australia (ASA) that its members and all participants in its activities are able to enjoy an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment. The ASA is therefore committed to making its meetings and events productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, nationality or religion. We will not tolerate harassment during ASA activities in any form.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all members of the ASA Council and ASA Chapters in their professional conduct. It also applies to all participants of ASA endorsed meetings.</p>
<p>We ask that you follow these guidelines:<br>
Behave professionally. Harassment and and sexist, racist, or exclusionary comments or jokes are not appropriate. Harassment includes sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, sexual attention or innuendo, deliberate intimidation, stalking, and photography or recording of an individual without consent. It also includes offensive comments related to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size or religion.</p>
<p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or sexist language and imagery is not appropriate. Be considerate and respectful to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Critique ideas rather than individuals.</p>
<p>Individuals asked to stop inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who does not comply may be stripped of their role in ASA official bodies or be asked to leave the event at the discretion of the ASA President or relevant event organisers (without a refund of registration fee). Anyone who wishes to report a violation of this policy is asked to speak confidentially to anyone on the organising committee, or members of the ANITA steering committee, or to the ASA president.</p>
